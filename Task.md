Instructions
Throughout the course, you'll often feel uncertain and lacking information — that's part of the experience.
Remember, the repository and Google are always there for you. So are your peers and Rocket.Chat. Collaborate. Explore. Use common sense. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes.
Be critical of your sources. Cross-check. Think. Analyze. Compare.
Read tasks carefully — and re-read them again.
Examples deserve attention too. They might include things not explicitly described in the task itself.
You may encounter inconsistencies — when something in a task or example contradicts what you thought you knew. Try to figure it out. If you can't — write down your question and work through it as you go. Don’t leave questions unresolved.
If something seems unclear or impossible — it probably just feels that way. Break it down. Most parts will make sense on their own.
You’ll come across many different kinds of tasks. The bonus ones are for the curious and meticulous. They're harder and optional — but completing them will give you extra knowledge and experience.
When you ask for help, always make sure you understand the why, how, and what for. Otherwise the help won’t mean much.
Always push to the develop branch only. The master branch will be ignored. Work inside the src directory.
Your directory must not contain any files other than those specified in the tasks.

Dungeon

Rogue is a computer game developed in 1980 by the company Epyx. Its central theme is dungeon exploration. The game was extremely popular on university Unix systems in the early 1980s and gave rise to an entire genre known as roguelikes.

In Rogue, the player takes on a role typical for early fantasy RPGs — that of an adventurer. The game begins on the topmost level of an unmapped dungeon filled with monsters and treasures. As the player progresses deeper into the randomly generated dungeon, enemies grow stronger and exploration becomes increasingly difficult.

Each dungeon level consists of a 3x3 grid of rooms or dead-end corridors that might have been expected to lead to a room. Later versions of the game also include “mazes” — winding corridors with dead ends — in addition to regular rooms. Unlike most adventure games of that era, the layout of the dungeon and the placement of objects within it are procedurally generated. This made every playthrough unique and equally challenging for both new and experienced players.

The player has three attributes: health, strength, and experience. These can be increased through potions and scrolls or reduced by traps and cursed scrolls. A wide variety of magical potions, scrolls, wands, weapons, armor, and food results in highly diverse gameplay and multiple ways to win or lose.

Application Architecture
When developing applied projects involving data, business logic, and user interfaces, a multi-layered architecture is commonly used. The classical layered division can be represented as follows:

Presentation Layer (View, UI)
Domain Layer (Business Logic)
Data Source Layer (Data Access)
Separating logic into business and presentation layers will help organize the application's logic more effectively and decouple components with different levels of stability.

In the presentation layer, place the code responsible for rendering the UI and handling user input. This is where interaction with the goncurses library (or similar) and the domain layer should be implemented.

The domain layer should encapsulate business logic that is independent of any frameworks. In this project, it includes the logic of game-related entities — such as the game itself, the player, enemies, levels, the map, and others — as well as the game mechanics. For example, the player's location and the logic for updating their position and attributes on the map must reside in this layer and then be passed to the presentation layer for rendering.
Note that, according to the clean architecture principle, the business logic layer must not depend on the other layers. This is achieved by applying the dependency inversion principle.

To organize interaction between layers more efficiently, you may also use practices from the MVC family of patterns (such as MVP, MVVM, MVPVM, and others). These patterns separate logic (Model) from presentation (View) using intermediary layers like Controllers, Presenters, or View Models. Each language and framework has its own preferred implementations, but the underlying principles remain quite similar.

The data layer in this application is responsible for managing data — in this case, storing the history of previous games as well as the data for the current game session.

Chapter III
Task 0 — How Did We Get Here?
The game application:

must have a console interface based on the goncurses library (or similar tcell, termui, ...);
must be controlled via keyboard;
must follow a well-designed, clean architecture with clear separation of layers;
must implement the core mechanics of the classic Rogue (1980) game, with some simplifications (specific gameplay requirements are described in the following sections);
if any aspects of gameplay design are not explicitly covered in this text, you may refer to the logic of the original 1980 mechanics as a valid basis.
Task 1 — The Essential Essences of the Game
The game must follow the layer separation described in the "Application Architecture" section. The implementation should clearly distinguish between the domain and gameplay layers, the rendering layer, and the data layer.

To begin development, implement the domain layer, which should define the core entities of the game. Below is a list of recommended entities with basic attributes (required but not exhaustive):

Game session
Level
Room
Corridor
Character, with attributes:
maximum health,
current health,
dexterity,
strength,
current weapon
Backpack
Enemy, with attributes:
type,
health,
dexterity,
strength,
hostility
Item, with attributes:
type,
subtype,
health (number of health points restored, e.g., for food),
maximum health (number of health points increased, e.g., for scrolls and elixirs — also increases the current max health),
dexterity (points increased, for scrolls and elixirs),
strength (points increased, for scrolls, elixirs, and weapons),
value (for treasures)
Task 2 — Energetic Gameplay
Implement the gameplay mechanics within the domain layer, independently of the presentation and data layers.

Game Logic

The game must contain 21 dungeon levels.
Each dungeon level must consist of 9 rooms connected by corridors, such that it is always possible to travel from any room to any other.
Each room may contain enemies and items — except for the starting room.
The player controls character movement, can interact with items, and fight enemies.
The goal on each level is to find the passage to the next one, ultimately progressing through all 21 levels.
At the beginning of each level, the player starts in a random location within the starting room, which is guaranteed to be free of enemies.
When the main character dies, the game resets and everything returns to the beginning.
As the player progresses to each new level:
the number and difficulty of enemies increases,
the amount of useful items decreases,
the amount of treasure dropped by defeated enemies increases.
After each run (whether successful or not), the player's result must be recorded in a leaderboard, showing:
the deepest level reached,
the amount of treasure collected.
The leaderboard must be sorted by treasure collected, in descending order.
The entire game must operate in turn-based mode: each player action triggers enemy actions.
Nothing in the game world moves until the player makes a move.
Character Logic

The health attribute represents the character’s current health.
When health reaches 0 or below, the game must end.
The maximum health attribute indicates the upper limit of health that can be restored by consuming food.
The dexterity attribute affects the hit probability formulas — both for enemies hitting the character and the character hitting enemies.
The strength attribute determines:
the base unarmed damage dealt by the character,
and contributes to the damage formula when using weapons.
Defeating an enemy rewards the character with treasure, based on the enemy’s difficulty.
The character can pick up items and store them in their backpack, then use them later.
When used, each item can temporarily or permanently modify one or more of the character’s attributes.
Upon reaching the level exit, the character automatically progresses to the next level.
Enemy Logic

Each enemy has attributes similar to the player’s: health, dexterity, and strength, plus an additional attribute — hostility.

The hostility attribute determines the distance at which the enemy starts chasing the player.

There are five types of enemies, each with unique traits and behavior patterns:

Zombie (display: green z)
Low dexterity
Medium strength and hostility
High health
Vampire (display: red v)
High dexterity, hostility, and health
Medium strength
Reduces the player’s maximum health upon a successful attack
The first hit against a vampire always misses
Ghost (display: white g)
High dexterity
Low strength, hostility, and health
Constantly teleports within the room
Periodically becomes invisible unless in active combat with the player
Ogre (display: yellow O)
Moves two tiles per turn within the room
Very high strength and health
Rests for one turn after each attack, then counterattacks with certainty
Low dexterity
Medium hostility
Snake-Mage (display: white s)
Very high dexterity
Moves diagonally across the map, constantly switching direction
Each successful attack has a chance to put the player to sleep for one turn
High hostility
Each enemy type follows its own movement pattern within a room.

When the player enters the hostility range of a monster, the monster begins to chase the player by following the shortest path using adjacent tiles.

If the player is within the aggression radius but there is no path to reach them, the monster continues to move randomly following its own movement pattern.

Environment Logic

Each item type has its own effect:
Treasures — have value, accumulate over time, and contribute to the final score. Treasures can only be obtained by defeating enemies.
Food — restores health by a certain amount.
Elixirs — temporarily increase one of the character’s attributes: dexterity, strength, or maximum health.
Scrolls — permanently increase one of the attributes: dexterity, strength, or maximum health.
Weapons — have a strength attribute.
When equipped, the damage calculation formula changes accordingly.
When the maximum health increases, the current health is also increased by the same amount.
If an elixir effect expires and the character’s health drops to 0 or below, the character’s health must be reset to the minimum possible positive value in order to continue the game.
The backpack holds all item types.
When the character steps on an item, it is automatically added to the backpack — if there is space.
The backpack can hold up to 9 items of each type.
Treasures are cumulative and stored in a single slot.
Food, elixirs, and scrolls are consumed upon use.
Weapons, when replaced, must be dropped on the floor to an adjacent tile.
Each dungeon level has content that scales with its depth:
The deeper the level, the more difficult it becomes.
A level consists of rooms.
Rooms are connected by corridors.
Rooms contain enemies and **items.
Both enemies and the player can move between rooms and corridors.
Each level contains a guaranteed passage to the next.
Exiting the final level ends the game.
Combat Logic

Combat is processed in turn-based mode.
An attack is initiated by moving the character toward an enemy.
Combat begins upon contact with the enemy.
Each strike is resolved in sequential stages:
Hit check — A probabilistic check is performed to determine whether the attack lands. The chance to hit depends on the dexterity of the attacker and the target.
Damage calculation — If the hit is successful, the damage is calculated based on the attacker's strength and any active modifiers (such as weapon stats).
Damage application — The calculated damage is subtracted from the target’s health. If health drops to 0 or below, the target — whether enemy or player — dies.
When an enemy is defeated, a random amount of treasure is dropped, based on the enemy’s hostility, strength, dexterity, and health.
Task 3 — Generated World
Implement the level generation module within the domain layer.
Each level must be logically divided into 9 sections, with a randomly generated room placed in each section.
Rooms must vary in size and position, generated randomly.
Rooms are connected by corridors, also generated procedurally.
Corridors have their own geometry, and characters must be able to move through them.
Therefore, their coordinates must also be generated and stored.
During generation, you must ensure that the resulting graph of rooms is connected and contains no structural errors.
Each level must include:
one starting room, where the game session begins;
one exit room, containing a special tile — when touched, it transfers the player to the next level.
An example implementation of level generation can be found in the code-samples folder.
Task 4 — Cozy 2D
Implement game rendering in the presentation layer using goncurses (or similar), based on the necessary domain entities.

Rendering

Environment rendering: walls, floor, wall openings, and corridors between rooms.
Actor rendering: player character, enemies, and collectible items.
Interface rendering: game UI, including status panel, inventory, and basic menus.
Fog of War — the rendered scene must depend on the current game state:
Unexplored rooms and corridors are not displayed.
Previously explored rooms where the player is not present are displayed as walls only.
The room containing the player displays walls, floor, actors, and items.
When standing near a room's entrance from a corridor, fog is lifted only for the field of view — calculated using Ray Casting and Bresenham's algorithm to determine the visible area.
An example rendering implementation can be found in the code-samples folder.
Controls

Character controls:
Move with the WASD keys
Use a weapon from the backpack: h
Use food from the backpack: j
Use an elixir from the backpack: k
Use a scroll from the backpack: e
When using any item from the backpack, the game must display a list of items of that type, asking the player which one to select (1–9).
When selecting a weapon, there must also be an option to unequip the weapon without removing it from the backpack (thus, for weapons, the choice range is 0–9).
Statistics

The game must collect and display a separate statistics view for all playthroughs, sorted by the total amount of treasure collected.
The stats must include:
total treasure collected
deepest level reached
number of defeated enemies
amount of food consumed
number of elixirs drunk
number of scrolls read
total hits dealt and received
number of tiles traveled
Task 5 — Cartridge With Battery
Implement the data layer, responsible for saving and loading the player’s game progress to and from a JSON file.
After each level is completed, the game must save the current statistics and the level number reached.
After restarting the game, if the player wants to continue the last saved session, the levels must be generated according to the saved data, and the player's progress must be fully restored (accumulated points, current attribute values), i.e., all session information must be recovered, down to the position and properties of individual entities.
All statistics from previous playthroughs must also be preserved.
When the player views the leaderboard, the best playthroughs should be shown (regardless of whether the run was completed or not).
Task 6 — Bonus: You Shall Not Pass!
Generate doors between rooms and corridors, along with keys to unlock them.
Implement a colored key system, inspired by the classic DOOM. When solving this task, use modified depth-first or breadth-first search algorithms to verify that:
all keys are accessible,
the level is free from softlocks (situations where progress becomes impossible due to design flaws).
Task 7 — Bonus: The Art of Balance
Add a dynamic difficulty adjustment system.

If the player progresses too easily, increase the difficulty.
If the player struggles, the game may provide slightly more helpful items
(e.g., more healing items if the player often loses health),
and reduce the number or difficulty of enemies.
Task 8 — Bonus: Imagine You’re a Table
Add a new enemy type: the Mimic (m, white), which mimics items.

High dexterity
Low strength
High health
Low hostility
Task 9 — Bonus: Fully Three-Dee
Add a 3D rendering mode, in which:

Still use ASCII characters in terminal
The main view switches to a first-person 3D perspective.
The 2D view remains available as a mini-map in the corner of the screen.
Controls are adapted accordingly:
W — move forward
S — move backward
A — turn left
D — turn right
To render rooms and corridors in 3D, use Ray Casting.
Walls in rooms and tunnels must have textures, so that the player's movement is visually perceptible.
