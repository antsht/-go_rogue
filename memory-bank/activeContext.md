Current focus
- Simplify mimic generation to align with standard enemy placement.

Recent changes
- Removed dedicated mimic placement logic; mimics now spawn via enemy generation.
- Added RNG-aware enemy factory and mimic item-appearance helpers in entities.

Next steps
- Verify mimic spawn balance vs. enemy count expectations.
- Add tests if the project scope expands or regressions appear.
